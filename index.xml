&lt;p&gt;If the person evaluating this has questions, you can reach me trough my email at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:t1roti00@students.oamk.fi&#34;&gt;t1roti00@students.oamk.fi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my study diary post for the Cloud Services Course, that i am taking in the University Of Applied Sciences in Oulu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;please-note-the-marked-date-is-the-date-that-the-page-was-last-updated-on&#34;&gt;Please note; The marked date is the date that the page was last updated on.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page will be updated on an weekly basis, answering the questions detailed on the course.
(By hosting this page on Github Pages, im sure this will be ample enough done for Free choice extra task bundle E)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;week-1-questions-with-answers&#34;&gt;Week 1 questions with answers;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Describe with short examples: SaaS, PaaS and IaaS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SaaS, Or software as a Service is a model for software licensing that is served on a subscription basis, and is hosted for example, in the cloud.
These are usually accessed by a client, for example, web browser. An good example of these would be Dropbox, or other cloud storage services
where you pay an X amount of money per month, to have access to their provided cloud storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PaaS, is Platform as a Service, where you buy a platform for creating software, instead of delivering the software itself online, like in SaaS. When you have the platform stored online
there is no need to worry about things such as operating systems, updates to software, among others. An example of PaaS would be Heroku, as it allows you
to deploy your application on their platform. But you do not own the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IaaS, or Infrastructure as a Service is similar to the two above, but its for infrastructure, such as servers. This is the most flexible computing model, but also most resource heavy.
Examples of IaaS would be for example, Linode, Digitalocean, and many other hosting providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List and explain usual VPS advantages for small / start-up companies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VPS hosting´s advantages include but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affordable compared to dedicated hosting. Dedicated hosting is way more expensive than an VPS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enchanced security compared to shared hosting. Its not as good as dedicated hosting, but its better than shared hosting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility, for example scaling better to a larger capacity, if the need occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freedom, as in being able run your own OS and software on the server, for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resource consistency, as in the server not being shared with other people in shared hosting manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your thoughts about unexpected or hidden costs when using elastic cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that you have flexible costs is a good thing in my opinion, because it allows you to pay only what you use for. It is good if your access credentials are well secured with 2-factor authentication among other things.
But if, for example your account gets breached, and your server starts gaining extra costs due to it being used unauthorized, using up more resources, or potentially having your data compromised, it will be an unpleasant surprise to
the owner of the server, and the users whose data is stored on the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is &amp;ldquo;shadow IT&amp;rdquo; and why it is causing significant troubles for many organisations and enterprises? Especially cloud shadow IT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadow IT is using systems, devices, software, etc. without explicit it-department approval. While shadow IT can improve productivity and innovate
it also has its troubles. Those including but not being limited to: data leak, security risks, possibility of malware. For example, running an unknown
piece of software could cause your infrastructure to be compromised. But on the other hand, not practicing shadow IT is restricting
employee freedom, due to the IT team not being aware of every possible application to ever exist. Its always a trade-off of security VS employee productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>A short story on how i setup this website. I found this hugo theme after i got tired of my plain old website,and i wanted a challenge. So i started googling for some better solutions. Then i ended up on finding this framework for building websites called Hugo. and it looked robust enough, and easy enough to setup as a total newbie to webpage building. After looking around the hugo themes section, i found the perfect setup.</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-short-story-on-how-i-setup-this-website&#34;&gt;A short story on how i setup this website.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this hugo theme after i got tired of my plain old website,and i wanted a challenge. So i started googling for some better solutions.
Then i ended up on finding this framework for building websites called &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo.&lt;/a&gt; and it looked robust enough,
and easy enough to setup as a total newbie to webpage building. After looking around the hugo themes section, i found the perfect setup.
A lovely theme called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal&#34;&gt;Terminal by panr&lt;/a&gt;, and it looked really nice to my eye. So i started on my journey
to making my page with hugo. As in why this theme stood out to me, the pre-bundled themes did look really good in my eye. And hey, i love the color pink,
but theres also more color options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing that i needed to do, was to search for Hugo´s &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/&#34;&gt;Quick start guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that i did, was install hugo´s extended version. Using a packagemanager called &lt;a href=&#34;https://scoop.sh/&#34;&gt;Scoop&lt;/a&gt;, it was easy as typing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scoop install hugo-extended&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;into the command prompt after having installed scoop in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then i generated a new site using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hugo new site quickstart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then i added the presupplied configuration file found on the github site of the terminal theme (linked above) with the terminal theme, into &lt;strong&gt;config.toml&lt;/strong&gt; file in the hugo root directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then i added the first blogpost with using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hugo new posts/file-name-here.md&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And editing the new file, that was generated in the posts folder. As the .md extension implies, the site uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown&#34;&gt;Markdown technology.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markdown syntax is still something new that im learning. So these blog posts might look prettier, some day i hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at this point, i started the local envivorment by running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hugo server -d&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the command prompt, while being in the server root folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That launched a local development server, that will autoupdate (a really nice feature.) into localhost:1313 by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once i had done the changes i wanted, i navigated to the root folder, and specified where hugo will build the static pages, by using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hugo -D folder/path/here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then i deployed this using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;Github pages&lt;/a&gt; tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this was a dive into something new, that i enjoyed doing.&lt;/p&gt;
