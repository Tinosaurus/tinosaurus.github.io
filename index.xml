      <description>Disclaimer: This might not be the most efficient method of doing this. But this is what I managed to do. And it works. Mostly. This will also work with other music players that have the capability of outputting the song metadata in wanted format. Oh My Posh is a theme engine for shell windows. It supports shells such as powershell, cmd (Not fully native, with Clink.), bash and many others.</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;disclaimer-this-might-not-be-the-most-efficient-method-of-doing-this-but-this-is-what-i-managed-to-do-and-it-works-mostly-this-will-also-work-with-other-music-players-that-have-the-capability-of-outputting-the-song-metadata-in-wanted-format&#34;&gt;Disclaimer: This might not be the most efficient method of doing this. But this is what I managed to do. And it works. Mostly. This will also work with other music players that have the capability of outputting the song metadata in wanted format.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohmyposh.dev/&#34;&gt;Oh My Posh&lt;/a&gt; is a theme engine for shell windows. It supports shells such as powershell, cmd (Not fully native, with Clink.), bash and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a prompt theme that I liked. But I wanted it to show my currently playing song. After checking the pre-listed segments from their site. Spotify, and Youtube Music (Desktop App) seemed to be supported out of the box.
Musicbee and a lot of others were not. Oh well, time to start tinkering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I headed over to the Command segment to check out how would i be able to run a custom shell command. Then when i opened the segment, i was greeted with an immediate warning about using commands on powershell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While powerful, it tends to take a lot of time executing the command on PowerShell. Even with –noprofile it&amp;rsquo;s noticeably slower compared to sh. It&amp;rsquo;s advised to look at using environment variables when using PowerShell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, well. After promptly ignoring this, because i wanted to try things my way first, googling how to input text file contents into powershell and just trying to get-content (or gc for short.) the txt file, it didnt work. (Or at least, I did not bother trying to troubleshoot it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;next-up-actually-trying-the-environmental-variables-like-it-was-suggested&#34;&gt;Next up: Actually trying the environmental variables like it was suggested.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I promptly created an environmental variable named NowPlaying, and tried outputting it using  .Env.NowPlaying as the template. Perfect. It prints the hello world, that i had set in. But now.. How to make the env read from a file..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With updates..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some time thinking about it&amp;hellip; I realize again that get-content exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put Get-Content &amp;hellip;\CurrentSong.txt as the env, And realize that it just prints out the said command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then i google how to set and environmental variable according to txt file contents, And then i find it. Merging Get-Content with SetX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So i type out this powershell script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get-Content &amp;hellip;\Tags.txt | Foreach-Object {SETX NowPlaying $_}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run the script. And to my enjoyment, It works. The environmental variable that I set is now the song name I had playing. I skip over excitedly to the next song, look at the env again after confirming that
the txt file contents had indeed changed, Not updated. Here is the part where I realize that im going to need to automate this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is where i would like to thank whoever who originally created Task Scheduler for windows. This thing made it all possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To spare you most of the pain, im just going to list the task settings below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name the task however you want.
Set it to Run whether user is logged on or not.
Make it run with highest privileges.
Set it to Trigger one time, On a schedule, at X time.
Repeat task every 1 minute, for a duration Indefinitely.
Make sure that the task does &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; stop  if it runs longer than X amount of time.
Also make sure it does not expire.
The action you want, is to start a program, namely powershell.
In arguments, type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-WindowStyle hidden -File File\Path\Here\ScriptName.PS1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WindowStyle hidden is used to run the command stealthily, so that you wont have a powershell window popping up every minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In settings;
Task can be ran on demand.
Set it to run as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now start it once, and let it run in the background. It will automatically update the Env value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need it more often than once a minute?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setup duplicates to run at diffrent times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duplicate 1 runs at every minute on the dot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duplicate 2 runs at 10 seconds after every minute.
etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End result looks.. Something like this.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/U5YPeAP.png&#34; alt=&#34;The ready console print&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one bug that this has that bothers me.. Is this. When you hit enter again to refresh the prompt, it wont auto update. It will only update on fresh opens of your terminal of choice.
This might be an issue with &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohmyposh.dev/&#34;&gt;Oh My Posh&lt;/a&gt; or it might be an configuration issue, that im not aware of yet. Ill update this if i find a fix.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;hi-there&#34;&gt;Hi there!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Tino Roivanen, but online I like to go by multiple names, but most commonly Tinosaurus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the person evaluating this has questions, you can reach me through my email at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:t1roti00@students.oamk.fi&#34;&gt;t1roti00@students.oamk.fi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my study diary post for the Cloud Services Course, that I am taking in the University Of Applied Sciences in Oulu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;please-note-the-marked-date-is-the-date-that-the-page-was-last-updated-on&#34;&gt;Please note; The marked date is the date that the page was last updated on.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page will be updated on a weekly basis, answering the questions detailed on the course.
By hosting this page on GitHub Pages, im sure this will be ample enough done for Free choice extra task bundle E.
Link to a post detailing how the page is set up can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://tinosaurus.github.io/posts/my-first-post/&#34;&gt;Here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;week-1&#34;&gt;Week 1;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Describe with short examples: SaaS, PaaS and IaaS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SaaS, Or software as a Service is a model for software licensing that is served on a subscription basis, and is hosted for example, in the cloud.
These are usually accessed by a client, for example, web browser. A good example of these would be Dropbox, or other cloud storage services
where you pay an X amount of money per month, to have access to their provided cloud storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PaaS, is Platform as a Service, where you buy a platform for creating software, instead of delivering the software itself online, like in SaaS. When you have the platform stored online
there is no need to worry about things such as operating systems, updates to software, among others. An example of PaaS would be Heroku, as it allows you
to deploy your application on their platform. But you do not own the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IaaS, or Infrastructure as a Service is similar to the two above, but it&amp;rsquo;s for infrastructure, such as servers. This is the most flexible computing model, but also most resource heavy.
Examples of IaaS would be for example, Linode, Digitalocean, and many other hosting providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List and explain usual VPS advantages for small / start-up companies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VPS hosting´s advantages include but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affordable compared to dedicated hosting. Dedicated hosting is way more expensive than an VPS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhanced security compared to shared hosting. It&amp;rsquo;s not as good as dedicated hosting, but it&amp;rsquo;s better than shared hosting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility, for example scaling better to a larger capacity, if the need occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freedom, as in being able to run your own OS and software on the server, for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resource consistency, as in the server not being shared with other people in shared hosting manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your thoughts about unexpected or hidden costs when using elastic cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that you have flexible costs is a good thing in my opinion, because it allows you to pay only what you use for. It is good if your access credentials are well secured with 2-factor authentication among other things.
But if, for example your account gets breached, and your server starts gaining extra costs due to it being used unauthorized, using up more resources, or potentially having your data compromised, it will be an unpleasant surprise to
the owner of the server, and the users whose data is stored on the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is &amp;ldquo;shadow IT&amp;rdquo; and why it is causing significant troubles for many organisations and enterprises? Especially cloud shadow IT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadow IT is using systems, devices, software, etc. without explicit it-department approval. While shadow IT can improve productivity and innovate
it also has its troubles. Those including but not being limited to: data leak, security risks, possibility of malware. For example, running an unknown
piece of software could cause your infrastructure to be compromised. But on the other hand, not practicing shadow IT is restricting
employee freedom, due to the IT team not being aware of every possible application to ever exist. It&amp;rsquo;s always a trade-off of security VS employee productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;week-2&#34;&gt;Week 2;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tinosaurus.github.io/posts/second-post/&#34;&gt;I also did build an autonomous Weather Post upon connecting to my raspberry pi, that i published a separate blog post of, to complete extra task bundle J, click here to access that blogpost.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;serverless architecture&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a method of software designing that allows developers to build and run software without having to manage the infrastructure keeping it up. Developers can write and deploy code to any scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Describe shortly what is Kubernetes and what alternatives are there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is a system for deployment, scaling, and management of application containers, also known as (CaaS) Container as a Service. Alternatives can include
Azure Kubernetes Service, Google Cloud Run, AWS Fargate&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would now use a virtualized Windows operating system in your laptop (whatever operating system the laptop already has): Which virtualization platform (VMware, Virtualbox, Hyper-V, KVM etc&amp;hellip;) would you use and why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My choice would be Oracle VM VirtualBox, due to the fact that I have earlier experience with the software, so im already somewhat familiar with it, also it is the best option
for my use needs, being able to use multiple operating systems as host (windows, mac &amp;amp; linux), ease of use and being free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List some benefits of IaC (Infrastructure as Code) for modern software development&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its less risky making your infrastructure as code than having one person do them by hand, as if that person leaves, they could take all the knowledge of the systems with them.
Optimization also becomes very much easier when you can easier see what is causing troubles in your infrastructure, and you have better documentation with the code that has been developed by multiple people rather than
having entire infrastructure managed by one person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;week-3&#34;&gt;Week 3;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nKuK7Tp9KM&#34;&gt;This week I decided to do the task of setting up a web server with a dashboard to my raspberry pi. The video with some documentation can be seen by clicking here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is my Free choice extra task bundle A terms explained using a few sentences for each term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bare metal server: A physical computer server that is used by a single customer only. Each server is a distinct physical piece of hardware that is a fully functional server on its own. Bare metal servers are dedicated entirely to the entity who is renting them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Broker: A single point of entry to manage multiple cloud services. As cloud computing evolves, integration of cloud services might get too complex for consumers to manage alone, and that&amp;rsquo;s where Cloud Brokers are meant to help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microservices: An application built as a collection of smaller services. This architecture enables rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large and complex applications, and enables the technology stack to be evolved more easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elastic computing: Ability to scale the usage of resources (ex. cpu/memory/ram/storage/bandwidth) up and down to adapt to changing resource demands and meeting workload requirements dynamically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Federation: Deployment of both external and internal services to match business needs. Integrating private, community, and public clouds into scalable computing platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS Lambda: Serverless compute service that lets you run code for any type of application and/or backend service without managing or provisioning servers. Operates on a pay for what you use basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FaaS: FaaS, also known as Function as Service, provides a platform to develop run and manage applications and their functionalities without building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with it. Building an app with this model is considered a way of &amp;ldquo;Serverless Architecture&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DaaS: DaaS, also known as Desktop as a Service, is a computing offering where a service provides virtual desktops to end users over the internet, usually licensed with a per-user subscription format. These can be persistent desktops, ones that stay the same. Or non-persistent ones, that get wiped after every logout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSO: SSO, also known as Single sign-on is an authentication method that allows a user to log in to several related, yet independent software systems with a single ID. This is used in for example, school networks. Where the same login will give you access to Wi-Fi, your courses, etc etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managed DNS: Managed DNS is a model of DNS where customer utilizes a DNS Server hosted by a service provider to store their DNS records and enables internet access with a domain name instead of just directly inserting an ip address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Origin Server: A computer running programs designed to listen and to respond to incoming requests and / or traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Firebase: A platform developed by google for mobile and web application creation. Useful for building apps, releasing and monitoring them, and monitoring user engagement within the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LAMP:One of the most common software stacks of Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Perl/Python. It can also be used to refer a generic software stack model and its components can be changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mashup Service: A mashup is a webpage or an application that uses content from more than one source to create a single new service, basically combining multiple services together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Middleware: Middleware is described as &amp;ldquo;software glue&amp;rdquo;, being a software that provides services to software application beyond those available straight from the operating system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubiquitous Computing: A concept in software engineering, hardware and computer science where computing is made to appear anytime and everywhere. It&amp;rsquo;s the concept of using small internet connected and inexpensive computers to help with everyday functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SLA: SLA also known as Service-level agreement is a commitment between a service provider and a client. Aspects of the commitment (ex. quality, availability, etc.) are agreed between the provider and the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TCO:TCO, an acronym for Total cost of ownership, is a financial estimate intended to help buyers and owners determine the direct and also indirect costs of a product and / or service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vendor Lock-in: The act of making customer dependent on a certain vendor for products, unable to use another vendors without substantial switching costs. For example: proprietary connectors are a method of vendor lock-in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utility Computing: A service provisioning model where a service provider makes resources and infrastructure management available as needed and charges for specific usage rather than a flat rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fog Computing(Fogging): An architecture that has edge devices carrying out a substantial amount of computation storage and communication locally and routed over the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network Slicing: Overlaying multiple virtual networks on top of a shared network domain. Often used in 5G networks as a fundamental capability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Websocket: A communications protocol providing communication channels over a single TCP connection. Enables interaction between a client application and a server with lower overhead than alternatives such as HTTP polling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;week-4&#34;&gt;Week 4&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is my answers for the week 4 questions, and the extra task bundle B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you could change one of your home or work appliances/devices to an internet connected device, what would it be? Which cloud IoT services would you like to use for it (and why)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would pick my lights. Because if I forget them on, I could turn them off when im not home from an app on my phone for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimate how much would it cost to run your own gaming PC instance in the Azure cloud as DaaS/VDI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on an VM in South Sweden, with 8 cores, 16gb ram, 80gb of temporary storage, and accounting for an 2048GiB HDD, and 2tb of outbound data transfer, the monthly cost would be 890.20€, this is probably way overkill, as this is set for 24/7 operation for the entire month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your thoughts or examples of cloud based on-demand gaming and streaming&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be a good thing, for example for people with a high bandwidth speed, and lower end devices. These cloud services also tend to have bigger libraries, and paying a monthly fee for a larger library might seem as a compelling business model for some users.
But for people with slower bandwidth speeds, or people with already a functioning gaming pc, this will not seem as useful. Overall, cloud gaming DOES have a valid reason for its share in the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search and describe examples of CAP theorem in cloud services context&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAP theorem is the theory that any data storage can provide only two of the following three guarantees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Availability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partition tolerance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a network failure happens it must be decided whether to cancel the active transfer and thus decrease the availability to ensure consistency, or to
proceed with the operation, and be more available but risk inconsistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listed below there are answers for my free choice extra task bundle B&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What to consider and compare when choosing a VPS server provider and VPS server features: What are your special needs, for example. RAM, Storage, Fast storage, What will you use it for, and the location of the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The benefits, risks and challenges of hybrid cloud computing: Splitting your computing resources for cost efficiency, having improved security (multiple logins needed for separate services), better accessibility and flexibility if you need to increase resources. The biggest risks and challenges being The tools and skills required, the data and application integration issues, and networking, and the downsides of splitting your resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why HTTP/2 (and HTTP/3) will/may speed up many web based cloud services? What is the current HTTP/2 adaptation rate now?: The Main advantages of HTTP/3 is increased performance compared to HTTP/2, supporting newer technologies, and therefore having better security. HTTP/2 is being used on around 45% of all websites as of beginning of September 2022.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is (5G) mobile edge computing? How it may change IoT and mobile device use?: Mobile edge computing is having computing, storage, and networking resources be integrated with the base stations. Mobile edge computing will be effecting latency, bandwidth, and the agility of connecting high amounts of devices to networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;week-5&#34;&gt;Week 5&lt;/h1&gt;

      <description>This wasnt a big scale project by any means, but this is something that i found useful for myself. This project featured me using wttr.in to check the weather with a console orientated service. I configured it to print out the local weather for the 3 following days, at 4 diffrent times (Morning, Noon, Evening and Night)
Usage is simple(ish):
Use either curl, on linux based systems, or Invoke-RestMethod in PowerShell on windows as a base for all the commands.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;This wasnt a big scale project by any means, but this is something that i found useful for myself. This project featured me
using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in&#34;&gt;wttr.in&lt;/a&gt; to check the weather with a console orientated service. I configured it to print out the local weather for the 3 following days, at 4 diffrent times (Morning, Noon, Evening and Night)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usage is simple(ish):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use either curl, on linux based systems, or Invoke-RestMethod in PowerShell on windows as a base for all the commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;curl &lt;a href=&#34;https://wttr.in&#34;&gt;https://wttr.in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will print the data based on your IP-Adresses geolocational data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, what if you use a VPN for example, to mask your geolocational data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, no problem. You can add the desired url to the end of your location. For example;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;curl &lt;a href=&#34;https://wttr.in/Helsinki&#34;&gt;https://wttr.in/Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also works on other location types, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;City Names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Airport Codes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Area Codes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPS Coordinates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The returned calls are largely customizeable, with things such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weather Units&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diffrent output formats (print a .png file for example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Print only one line of data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data-rich output format (Seems to have an limited amount of api calls)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moon phases and others, such as time of sunset and sunrise with a customizeable output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for example: The custom Output i  made looks like this (I have scrapped the location, as this is going to be public on the internet afterall.);&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A short story on how i setup this website. I found this hugo theme after i got tired of my plain old website,and i wanted a challenge. So i started googling for some better solutions. Then i ended up on finding this framework for building websites called Hugo. and it looked robust enough, and easy enough to setup as a total newbie to webpage building. After looking around the hugo themes section, i found the perfect setup.</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-short-story-on-how-i-setup-this-website&#34;&gt;A short story on how i setup this website.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this hugo theme after i got tired of my plain old website,and i wanted a challenge. So i started googling for some better solutions.
Then i ended up on finding this framework for building websites called &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo.&lt;/a&gt; and it looked robust enough,
and easy enough to setup as a total newbie to webpage building. After looking around the hugo themes section, i found the perfect setup.
A lovely theme called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal&#34;&gt;Terminal by panr&lt;/a&gt;, and it looked really nice to my eye. So i started on my journey
to making my page with hugo. As in why this theme stood out to me, the pre-bundled themes did look really good in my eye. And hey, i love the color pink,
but theres also more color options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing that i needed to do, was to search for Hugo´s &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/&#34;&gt;Quick start guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that i did, was install hugo´s extended version. Using a packagemanager called &lt;a href=&#34;https://scoop.sh/&#34;&gt;Scoop&lt;/a&gt;, it was easy as typing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scoop install hugo-extended&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;into the command prompt after having installed scoop in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then i generated a new site using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hugo new site quickstart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then i added the presupplied configuration file found on the github site of the terminal theme (linked above) with the terminal theme, into &lt;strong&gt;config.toml&lt;/strong&gt; file in the hugo root directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then i added the first blogpost with using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hugo new posts/file-name-here.md&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And editing the new file, that was generated in the posts folder. As the .md extension implies, the site uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown&#34;&gt;Markdown technology.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markdown syntax is still something new that im learning. So these blog posts might look prettier, some day i hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at this point, i started the local envivorment by running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hugo server -d&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the command prompt, while being in the server root folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That launched a local development server, that will autoupdate (a really nice feature.) into localhost:1313 by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once i had done the changes i wanted, i navigated to the root folder, and specified where hugo will build the static pages, by using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hugo -D folder/path/here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then i deployed this using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;Github pages&lt;/a&gt; tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this was a dive into something new, that i enjoyed doing.&lt;/p&gt;
