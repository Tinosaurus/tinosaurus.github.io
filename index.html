<p>This wasnt a big scale project by any means, but this is something that i found useful for myself. This project featured me
using <a href="https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in">wttr.in</a> to check the weather with a console orientated service. I configured it to print out the local weather for the 3 following days, at 4 diffrent times (Morning, Noon, Evening and Night)</p>
<p>Usage is simple(ish):</p>
<p>Use either curl, on linux based systems, or Invoke-RestMethod in PowerShell on windows as a base for all the commands.</p>
<p>Using</p>
<blockquote>
<p>curl <a href="https://wttr.in">https://wttr.in</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Will print the data based on your IP-Adresses geolocational data.</p>
<p>But, what if you use a VPN for example, to mask your geolocational data?</p>
<p>Well, no problem. You can add the desired url to the end of your location. For example;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>curl <a href="https://wttr.in/Helsinki">https://wttr.in/Helsinki</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It also works on other location types, such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>City Names</li>
<li>Airport Codes</li>
<li>Area Codes</li>
<li>GPS Coordinates</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The returned calls are largely customizeable, with things such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Weather Units</li>
<li>Diffrent output formats (print a .png file for example)</li>
<li>Print only one line of data</li>
<li>Data-rich output format (Seems to have an limited amount of api calls)</li>
<li>Moon phases and others, such as time of sunset and sunrise with a customizeable output.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So for example: The custom Output i  made looks like this (I have scrapped the location, as this is going to be public on the internet afterall.);</p>

            <h1 id="a-short-story-on-how-i-setup-this-website">A short story on how i setup this website.</h1>
<p>I found this hugo theme after i got tired of my plain old website,and i wanted a challenge. So i started googling for some better solutions.
Then i ended up on finding this framework for building websites called <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo.</a> and it looked robust enough,
and easy enough to setup as a total newbie to webpage building. After looking around the hugo themes section, i found the perfect setup.
A lovely theme called <a href="https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal">Terminal by panr</a>, and it looked really nice to my eye. So i started on my journey
to making my page with hugo. As in why this theme stood out to me, the pre-bundled themes did look really good in my eye. And hey, i love the color pink,
but theres also more color options.</p>
<p>First thing that i needed to do, was to search for Hugo´s <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Quick start guide</a>.</p>
<p>The first thing that i did, was install hugo´s extended version. Using a packagemanager called <a href="https://scoop.sh/">Scoop</a>, it was easy as typing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>scoop install hugo-extended</p>
</blockquote>
<p>into the command prompt after having installed scoop in the first place.</p>
<p>Then i generated a new site using</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hugo new site quickstart</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then i added the presupplied configuration file found on the github site of the terminal theme (linked above) with the terminal theme, into <strong>config.toml</strong> file in the hugo root directory.</p>
<p>Then i added the first blogpost with using</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hugo new posts/file-name-here.md</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And editing the new file, that was generated in the posts folder. As the .md extension implies, the site uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown technology.</a></p>
<p>The markdown syntax is still something new that im learning. So these blog posts might look prettier, some day i hope.</p>
<p>at this point, i started the local envivorment by running</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hugo server -d</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in the command prompt, while being in the server root folder.</p>
<p>That launched a local development server, that will autoupdate (a really nice feature.) into localhost:1313 by default.</p>
<p>Once i had done the changes i wanted, i navigated to the root folder, and specified where hugo will build the static pages, by using</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hugo -D folder/path/here</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then i deployed this using the <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> tutorial.</p>
<p>Overall, this was a dive into something new, that i enjoyed doing.</p>
