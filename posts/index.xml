      <description>Disclaimer: This might not be the most efficient method of doing this. But this is what I managed to do. And it works. Mostly. This will also work with other music players that have the capability of outputting the song metadata in wanted format. Oh My Posh is a theme engine for shell windows. It supports shells such as powershell, cmd (Not fully native, with Clink.), bash and many others.</description>

But this is what I managed to do. And it works. Mostly. This will also work with other music players that have the capability of outputting the song metadata in wanted format.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohmyposh.dev/&#34;&gt;Oh My Posh&lt;/a&gt; is a theme engine for shell windows. It supports shells such as powershell, cmd (Not fully native, with Clink.), bash and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a prompt theme that I liked. But I wanted it to show my currently playing song. After checking the pre-listed segments from their site. Spotify, and Youtube Music (Desktop App) seemed to be supported out of the box.
Musicbee and a lot of others were not. Oh well, time to start tinkering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I headed over to the Command segment to check out how would i be able to run a custom shell command. Then when i opened the segment, i was greeted with an immediate warning about using commands on powershell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While powerful, it tends to take a lot of time executing the command on PowerShell. Even with –noprofile it&amp;rsquo;s noticeably slower compared to sh. It&amp;rsquo;s advised to look at using environment variables when using PowerShell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, well. After promptly ignoring this, because i wanted to try things my way first, googling how to input text file contents into powershell and just trying to get-content (or gc for short.) the txt file, it didnt work. (Or at least, I did not bother trying to troubleshoot it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;next-up-actually-trying-the-environmental-variables-like-it-was-suggested&#34;&gt;Next up: Actually trying the environmental variables like it was suggested.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I promptly created an environmental variable named NowPlaying, and tried outputting it using  .Env.NowPlaying as the template. Perfect. It prints the hello world, that i had set in. But now.. How to make the env read from a file..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With updates..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some time thinking about it&amp;hellip; I realize again that get-content exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put Get-Content &amp;hellip;\CurrentSong.txt as the env, And realize that it just prints out the said command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then i google how to set and environmental variable according to txt file contents, And then i find it. Merging Get-Content with SetX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So i type out this powershell script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get-Content &amp;hellip;\Tags.txt | Foreach-Object {SETX NowPlaying $_}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run the script. And to my enjoyment, It works. The environmental variable that I set is now the song name I had playing. I skip over excitedly to the next song, look at the env again after confirming that
the txt file contents had indeed changed, Not updated. Here is the part where I realize that im going to need to automate this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is where i would like to thank whoever who originally created Task Scheduler for windows. This thing made it all possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To spare you most of the pain, im just going to list the task settings below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name the task however you want.
Set it to Run whether user is logged on or not.
Make it run with highest privileges.
Set it to Trigger one time, On a schedule, at X time.
Repeat task every 1 minute, for a duration Indefinitely.
Make sure that the task does &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; stop  if it runs longer than X amount of time.
Also make sure it does not expire.
The action you want, is to start a program, namely powershell.
In arguments, type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-WindowStyle hidden -File File\Path\Here\ScriptName.PS1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WindowStyle hidden is used to run the command stealthily, so that you wont have a powershell window popping up every minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In settings;
Task can be ran on demand.
Set it to run as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now start it once, and let it run in the background. It will automatically update the Env value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need it more often than once a minute?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setup duplicates to run at diffrent times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duplicate 1 runs at every minute on the dot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duplicate 2 runs at 10 seconds after every minute.
etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End result looks.. Something like this.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/U5YPeAP.png&#34; alt=&#34;The ready console print&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one bug that this has that bothers me.. Is this. When you hit enter again to refresh the prompt, it wont auto update. It will only update on fresh opens of your terminal of choice.
This might be an issue with &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohmyposh.dev/&#34;&gt;Oh My Posh&lt;/a&gt; or it might be an configuration issue, that im not aware of yet. Ill update this if i find a fix.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using a cloud service API for something meanful.</title>

      <description>This wasnt a big scale project by any means, but this is something that i found useful for myself. This project featured me using wttr.in to check the weather with a console orientated service. I configured it to print out the local weather for the 3 following days, at 4 diffrent times (Morning, Noon, Evening and Night)
Usage is simple(ish):
Use either curl, on linux based systems, or Invoke-RestMethod in PowerShell on windows as a base for all the commands.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;curl &lt;a href=&#34;https://wttr.in&#34;&gt;https://wttr.in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will print the data based on your IP-Adresses geolocational data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, what if you use a VPN for example, to mask your geolocational data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, no problem. You can add the desired url to the end of your location. For example;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;curl &lt;a href=&#34;https://wttr.in/Helsinki&#34;&gt;https://wttr.in/Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also works on other location types, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;City Names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Airport Codes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Area Codes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPS Coordinates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The returned calls are largely customizeable, with things such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weather Units&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diffrent output formats (print a .png file for example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Print only one line of data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data-rich output format (Seems to have an limited amount of api calls)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moon phases and others, such as time of sunset and sunrise with a customizeable output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for example: The custom Output i  made looks like this (I have scrapped the location, as this is going to be public on the internet afterall.);&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A short story on how i setup this website. I found this hugo theme after i got tired of my plain old website,and i wanted a challenge. So i started googling for some better solutions. Then i ended up on finding this framework for building websites called Hugo. and it looked robust enough, and easy enough to setup as a total newbie to webpage building. After looking around the hugo themes section, i found the perfect setup.</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-short-story-on-how-i-setup-this-website&#34;&gt;A short story on how i setup this website.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this hugo theme after i got tired of my plain old website,and i wanted a challenge. So i started googling for some better solutions.
Then i ended up on finding this framework for building websites called &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo.&lt;/a&gt; and it looked robust enough,
and easy enough to setup as a total newbie to webpage building. After looking around the hugo themes section, i found the perfect setup.
A lovely theme called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal&#34;&gt;Terminal by panr&lt;/a&gt;, and it looked really nice to my eye. So i started on my journey
to making my page with hugo. As in why this theme stood out to me, the pre-bundled themes did look really good in my eye. And hey, i love the color pink,
but theres also more color options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing that i needed to do, was to search for Hugo´s &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/&#34;&gt;Quick start guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that i did, was install hugo´s extended version. Using a packagemanager called &lt;a href=&#34;https://scoop.sh/&#34;&gt;Scoop&lt;/a&gt;, it was easy as typing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scoop install hugo-extended&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;into the command prompt after having installed scoop in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then i generated a new site using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hugo new site quickstart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then i added the presupplied configuration file found on the github site of the terminal theme (linked above) with the terminal theme, into &lt;strong&gt;config.toml&lt;/strong&gt; file in the hugo root directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then i added the first blogpost with using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hugo new posts/file-name-here.md&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And editing the new file, that was generated in the posts folder. As the .md extension implies, the site uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown&#34;&gt;Markdown technology.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markdown syntax is still something new that im learning. So these blog posts might look prettier, some day i hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at this point, i started the local envivorment by running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hugo server -d&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the command prompt, while being in the server root folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That launched a local development server, that will autoupdate (a really nice feature.) into localhost:1313 by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once i had done the changes i wanted, i navigated to the root folder, and specified where hugo will build the static pages, by using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hugo -D folder/path/here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then i deployed this using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;Github pages&lt;/a&gt; tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this was a dive into something new, that i enjoyed doing.&lt;/p&gt;
